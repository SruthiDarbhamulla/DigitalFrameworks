# Assignment 2

_By Sruthi Darbhamulla_

## Question and justification: 
Are there organizations for queer South Asians in the USA, where are they and what are they doing? I wish to collect this dataset for a story about queer South Asians in the US in the broader context of immigration and cultural identity. Many South Asian countries are not open about LGBTQ+ rights and repressive laws still exist. For example, India decriminalized homosexuality via a Supreme Court decision only last year, in September. On the other hand, India has traditionally allowed for alternate sexual identities in the form of acceptance of the third gender in historical texts and legislation. This story would explore the dimensions of cultural and sexual identity and the freedom to explore these identities, with the backdrop of the South Asian community in the United States and in these countries. 

## List of things to know: 
* Are there any organizations dedicated to queer South Asians and their rights in the United States?
* Which cities are they located in? 
* What is their primary focus?
* What is their contact information? 
* Who is the leader of this organization? 
* How many members does this organization have? 
* What is the demographic make-up of the members? 
* What identities find the greatest representation, for e.g gay men, transwomen, bisexual men?
* How many queer South Asians are there in the United States? 
* How many queer people are there in each of the South Asian nations?

## How to go about collecting this data:
I would do a preliminary google search and collect contact information for each organization. I would then call each organization and ask them about their work, membership and additional resources for information, such as research they might be acquainted with or experts they trust. I would try to find data about the overall number of queer South Asians from government records or organizations like the Pew Research Center.
