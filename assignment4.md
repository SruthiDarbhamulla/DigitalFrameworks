# Pitch 

I plan to analyze the changes in South and South East Asian immigration to the United States after drastic changes within these nations. 
My question is: can we see the impact of regime changes, major events in the flow of immigration to the United States? 

I am planning to analyze immigration data from the US Census Bureau, Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute. I could talk to researchers from the Migration Policy Institute to get expert insight and analysis of any trends I may observe. Then, if possible, I would try to get a human face for my story by speaking to the immigrants from these communities about the reasons that compelled them to move here. 

A timeline showing the events and the changes in immigration patterns would be a good visualization for this story. Individual country-wise breakdowns could also be provided.

Immigration rhetoric in the US is largely moving away from a humanitarian understanding and an understanding of the impact of American military policy in other parts of the world. This is a good point in time to reflect about the root causes of immigration in a broader, global context. 

Further, Asians are a fast-growing migrant group in the US and it would be interesting to understand the phenomenon better. The story can later also be expanded to study the impact of these trends on the American population. 

And, to be very cynical, immigration stories are always newsworthy in Trumpâ€™s America.
