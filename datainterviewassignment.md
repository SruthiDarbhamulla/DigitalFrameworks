### Question 1: Where there any drastic reduction in population in major American cities from the year 2000 to 2010?
Answer: Yes. Cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana (29 percent decrease); Detroit, Michigan (almost 25 percent decrease) and Cleveland, Ohio (17 percent decrease) saw significant drops in population from 2000 to 2010 () When urban migration is thought of as a common phenomenon, it interesting to note that there was attrition from these particular cities. Detroit and Cleveland are rust belt cities; this might be a common linking factor, but where does New Orleans come in?

### Question 2:  What is the American city with the greatest population jump over 10 years? 
**Answer:** Buckeye in Arizona saw an increase of 678 percent from 6,537 to 50,876 in this span of 10 years. As of 2017, it was still the fastest growing city in the United States. https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/DFW-Fastest-Growing-Metro-in-US-Fort-Worth-Moves-Up-13th-Largest-City-510330671.html
This is definitely something that should be investigated. 

### Question 3: Are there any cities where the population has stayed almost the same over 10 years? 

**Answer:** Minneapolis, Minnesota saw a reduction of just 40 people over 10 years- a 0.01 percent decrease. Troy in Michigan saw an increase of 21, while Shoreline in Washington saw a reduction of 18 people over the same time period. The stability seems uncanny and worthy of investigation.

### Data diary: 
Data was reasonably well sorted out. I changed the format for the cell data to numbers and used filters to understand the variations. 

**Sample headline:** Fastest growing town in United States retains title over two decades 

**Sample nut graf:** New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have the largest populations in the United States, but they are nowhere near the fastest growing cities. In fact, they were not even part of the top 25 cities in 2010, according to US Census bureau data. Buckeye, Arizona, located 30 miles from downtown Phoenix, saw a 678 percent increase from 2000 to 2010. New York saw an increase of just 2.08 percent in the same 10-year span. Los Angeles saw an increase of 2.65 percent, while Chicago actually saw a decrease of about 7 percent in its population.
