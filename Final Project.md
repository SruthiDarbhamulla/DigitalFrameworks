# Refugee Admissions to the USA: A glimpse at the data 

_By Sruthi Darbhamulla_

Just today, NBC News [reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-admin-weighs-letting-states-cities-deny-entry-refugees-approved-n1044801) that the Trump administration was considering a draft proposal that would require state and city government consent for the resettlement of refugees.

This is the latest in the often-heated national conversation centered around immigration, refugees and asylum-seekers.

[According](https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/what-is-a-refugee/) to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (also known as the UN Refugee Agency), refugees have “a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group” and are individuals who “most likely...cannot return home or are afraid to do so” refugees differ from other types of entrants into the United States. 


This means that they present a unique long-term policy challenge as far as admission and resettlement are concerned. Recent policy proposals, including the travel ban, have sought to do away with the problem at its source point, by slashing the number of people who can enter the United States. For example, the cap for refugees for 2019 is 30,000, as [compared](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-admin-weighs-letting-states-cities-deny-entry-refugees-approved-n1044801) to a limit of 85,000 refugees in 2016. 

As the debate intensifies with the latest proposal from the administration, here are some key takeaways about refugee admission to the United States, culled from the Department of Homeland Security's [Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2017](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2017). 


### 1. The greatest number of refugees admitted to the United States was in 1980, the year Congress passed the Refugee Act which created the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program. 207,116 refugees were admitted in 1980 alone, compared to 53,691 in 2017.

### 2. Despite the Trump Administration’s bluster, the two years since his election did not see the lowest numbers of refugee admission. 
That honor goes to the 2002 and 2003. This dip can be attributed to tightened scrutiny in the months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 

As Arthur E. Dewey, Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and Migration [stated](https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/prm/rls/2003/37906.htm) in a 2003 address to the American Society for International Law, “after 9/11, a freeze on refugee admissions was put into effect for over two months while a comprehensive review of procedures was undertaken.” 

2004 saw a rise in refugee admissions, but not by astronomical proportions. 

### 3. The greatest number of refugee admissions were from 1989 to 1995
There was a significant increase from 1988 to 1989, which then continues for 6-7 years, then dips in 1996. The rise after 1990 [might](https://www.uscis.gov/history-and-genealogy/our-history/refugee-timeline) be attributed to the Lautenberg Amendment (named after a Democratic co-sponsor of the bill) an amendment which reduced the evidentiary burden for some categories of applicants, such as Jews and Christian minorities from the former Soviet Union, and some people from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. 

### 4. There was dip in the overall refugees admitted to the United States from 2016-2017, but there was an increase in in those from Europe. 

This is probably not due to an increased fondness for the Europeans.

As Bill Swersey, the vice president of communications at the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) says, “The decrease (in the overall number of refugees) from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 was a direct result of the Trump Administration’s Muslim and refugee bans.  I’m not aware of many (any) refugees from Europe other than from the former Soviet Union.  Most, if not all, come on the basis of religious discrimination.”

### 5. There was a substantial increase in refugees from Ukraine over a 4 year-period from 2013 to 2017

But before we jump to conclusions about this being due to the Civil War in Ukraine, Swersey clarifies that it is “highly unlikely that the civil war in Ukraine has led to anyone being resettled in the US.” 

He says that there is “usually a years-long lag time between the time a crisis or conflict creates refugees and the time they become considered for resettlement.”

### 6. There are drops in the refugees from Somalia, Sudan and Syria
Two words- [travel ban](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38781302). Turns out it did have an impact.

### 7. There was a significant drop in the number of refugees admitted from Burma (almost 58 percent) from 2016-2017

Swersey says that this is probably because “those who were eligible were resettled and the “pipeline” of refugees from Burma waiting for resettlement dried up.”


### 8. There was a jump in the number of refugees from El Salvador by almost three times.

While this [might](https://www.wola.org/analysis/fact-sheet-united-states-immigration-central-american-asylum-seekers/) be attributed to growing violence in Central American countries, there is no clear reason as to why this jump has taken place now.
