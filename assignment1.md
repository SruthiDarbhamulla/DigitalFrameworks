# Digital Frameworks Assignment 1

## Ideas

_Idea 1:_
My first idea centers on understanding the complex dynamics of immigration from South Asian, South East Asian and East Asian countries to the United States (Near Asia and the Middle-East shall be left out of the present discussion.) It shall analyze trends in Asian inflow to the United States and look at possible causes and co-relations, such as whether regime changes have resulted in this flow. Another element is observing whether immigration of particular communities has proportionally gone up or down compared to events which might be indicate such changes. For example, has Vietnamese immigration gone down post the end of the Vietnam war? Or has the Rohingya crisis increased immigration to America? The article would also include changes in student populations. Indian and Chinese students have traditionally led the pack, but there may be other variations in the makeup of the Asian student body in the United States that I would like to delve into.

_Note:_ This story just touches on how Asian immigration has increased over the years with an interesting infographic. I could not find published stories that deal with my precise subject. I did not think Pew Research Center analyses counted as stories, because those are the datasets that will inform my story. In particular, this one:[link text](https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/asian-americans/)

_Idea 2:_ 
Changing perceptions about women in legislative/judicial language

I would like to do an analysis about how language about women’s issues has changed over time in legislations. This would entail looking to specific legislations that deal with women. If that project does not yield enough variance, I would pivot to looking at landmark judgements and the way women and their issues are discussed in those. Judgements delivered by women justices will also be analyzed to understand if language used is the same or different from male colleagues, and in what ways (presuming that the language used is indeed better) 
Since the number of judgements and legislations is overwhelming, I shall limit myself to 10 or 15, and shall also potentially pick a year range for my analysis. 


_Published story:_ [link text](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/screen-direction/)

_Note:_ This story, while it varies wildly as to subject matter from my proposed story, does address the core issue I want to look at- the ways in which women are spoken about in various settings, as a reflection of perceptions about their place in society. 


## Analysis of published story
### Clarity and accuracy
* Able to understand central insight: 5 
    * What: The story is about gender tropes in films gleaned from an analysis of screen directions in 2000 scripts.
    * How: It was mentioned as part of the deck of the story. The headline was not very indicative, merely catchy. 
•	Able to understand how to navigate data: 4
o	Efficiency: It was efficient but could have been more so. There were three infographics in the story- a bar chart of the most frequently used words per gender, a list of the top 800 words paired with ‘he’ or ‘she’ words color-coded according to which gender they were associated with, and a graph with circles to demonstrate which words were used by writers of a particular gender. 
While the bar graph and the color-coded word list are both easy to understand, the graph with circles is a bit complicated at first glance. The size of the circles is supposed to indicate how often the word is used, but most of the circles seem around the same size, making understanding this metric difficult. The second element of data to be gleaned from the chart is that words far away from the axis exhibit dramatic differences. This is not very easy to comprehend either. 
o	Suggested improvements: A larger infographic might resolve some of the challenges in understanding the third dataset. A conventional bar chart or graph might be a cleaner way to plot this data but would also reduce the impact of the infographic.

•	Accuracy of data: 4
o	General sense of accuracy: The article is based of independent analysis by the journalist-engineers at Pudding. It is specified in the footnote that the code used is open source and available on GitHub, and a link is also provided. The methodology is explained with some detail and seems like a fair-minded and thorough process. However, it would still seem more trustworthy if they had used a third party to verify their findings. 
o	Possible sources: The reporter could have spoken to experts in the field of film and gender; even better, an expert in both gender _and_ film
Objective: Quality
•	Quality: 4
o	The story is very interesting but since there are some shortfalls in including expert sources, it does not seem as credible. Additionally, though the graphics are good, they are not as fascinating as they could be. The GIF of a scene playing in the background of the headline is a fun element. However, The Pudding’s own story about gender and age in the same 2,000 screenplays has even more engaging visual storytelling elements. (https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/)
•	The graphics did a good job of achieving the objectives that they are expected to fulfill:
o	Presentation: The stark difference in words used for each gender in screen direction was effectively presented, especially through the bar chart that highlights the most used words. 
o	Comparison: All three infographics offer the reader an opportunity to compare the differences in the words used for each gender. The use of the stereotypical colors for each gender also aid an easy comparison. 
o	Organization: The first two organize data well, but the third one, as mentioned above, does not clearly convey the data it wishes to explain
o	Correlation: The dataset used does not really lend itself to a breakdown into factors which have a co-relation between them. 
Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
•	Type: 3
The typography used in this article is not particularly arresting. The font used is a standard one and there aren’t any stylizations for sub-headings or key phrases. At the very least, a dropcap might have contributed some interest to the visual presentation. The headline uses some text shadow against an animated background, which is a good visual element, but not really a function of the typography.  
•	Color: 3
The background is a dull tan color, the text color is black, the only real colors are those used for the infographics- red to show common words for women, blue for common words for men and a few shades in between for the mid-ground words. A more exciting color palette would have definitely enlivened the story a fair bit. 

•	Creativity
•	Creativity: 4
As discussed above, the story is creative, but could have been even more visually compelling. The infographics are creatively visualized, but the use of the tan background weighs down the presentation. The presence of examples in the most common words used for men and women is a good touch, as is presenting what words are used by writers of the same gender. The writing itself is not very lyrical or exciting but the last line is interesting:  “The increase in female writers would also mean women would be more likely to spy, find things, and, perhaps most remarkably, write on-screen.”
